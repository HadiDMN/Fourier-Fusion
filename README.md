#Fourier Fusion

##Image Fusion in the Frequency Domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

Project Description:
FourierFusion is a Python project that demonstrates image fusion or combination in the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The project takes two input images, applies FFT, combines the magnitude and phase components, and then performs an inverse FFT to obtain the resulting images.

Features:

Image fusion in the frequency domain using FFT
Combination of magnitude and phase components from two input images
Inverse FFT to obtain the resulting images
Visualization of input and output images using Matplotlib
Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
NumPy (np) library
Matplotlib (plt) library
Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/HadiDMN/Fourier-Fusion.git
Install the required libraries: pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Place the input images (image1.jpg and image2.jpg) in the same directory as the script.
Run the script: python fourier_fusion.py
The output images will be displayed using Matplotlib.
Code Structure:

fourier_fusion.py: The main script that performs image fusion in the frequency domain.
image1.jpg and image2.jpg: Sample input images.
